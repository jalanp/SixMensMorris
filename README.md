Six Men's Morris
======================

###Current Features:
- start a new game
- set up a preset board

##Future Features:
- player vs. player or player vs. AI

Still Needs Fixing:
--------------------
- ending the game in a draw
- no possible moves for a player i.e. trapped pieces
- preset board begins on placement phase (doesn't work if we want to start at movement phase)
- in creating the preset board, sometimes gives an incorrect error
