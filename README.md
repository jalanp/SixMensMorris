Six Men's Morris
======================

####Current Features:
- start a new game
  * 2 player
  * 1 player (vs. AI)
- set up a preset board
- save/load a game

####Future Features:
- **_none at the moment_**

####Still Needs Fixing:
- ~~ending the game in a draw~~
- ~~no possible moves for a player i.e. trapped pieces~~  *Feature added in AI and Save/Load commit*
- preset board begins on placement phase (doesn't work if we want to start at movement phase)
- in creating the preset board, sometimes gives an incorrect error (usually first try of application)
- when loading, the first piece of the current player doesn't appear (still exists, just can't do anything with it)
- save/load not tested with AI
